## Troubleshooting

  ### The default chat filter blocks everything
  At this time you have to disable stripping accents in RuneLite's Chat Filter Plugins. 
  Runelite's Chat Filter Plugin strips the regex from both chat and it's regex. Causing the blocked accented vowels to block all vowels.
  Blocking accented characters is extremely powerful for catching bot text, as it's used almost exclusively by them. Of course, there's the downside of possibly blocking other languages. So this is subject to change.
